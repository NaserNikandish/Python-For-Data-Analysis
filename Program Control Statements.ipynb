    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Solving any computational problem requires executing a set of actions in a particular order. An algorithm is a list of instructions used in performing tasks. A cooking recipe found in any [Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cookbook&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) is the most common example of an algorithm. Any recipe has a list of instructions (actions) and order of these actions. Algorithms used for computational purposes are not much different. In the context of programming, an *algorithm*  is a set of procedures used for solving a problem. Any algorithm contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. the **actions** to be executed\n",
    "  2. the **order** in which these actions be executed\n",
    "    \n",
    "A Python program is a list of **actions** performed by the computer in a particular **order**. Python uses three different forms of *program control* for specifying the order of instructions: sequential execution, selection statement, and repetition statement. Most programs use combination of these program controls. \n",

    "\n",
    "## **Sequential execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In sequential execution, as the name suggests, statements are performed in the order they're written. Here is an example\n",
    " >```python\n",
    " > x = 10\n",
    " > y = 20\n",
    " > sum = x + y\n",
    " > average = sum / 2\n",
    " > print(average)\n",
    " >```\n",
    " \n",
    "Python executes these instructions sequentially (one after another one) to find average of two numbers. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<hr style=\"border: 0.3px solid gray; background-color:black; width:40%;\"></hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Selection statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "executes code based on a *condition* (an expression that evaluates to either *True* or *False*). Here is an early example\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    ">grade = 75\n",
    ">if grade >=70:\n",
    ">    print (\"pass\")\n",
    ">else:\n",
    ">    print (\"fail\")\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "This snippet will **not** performs instructions sequentially. Only one of the 3rd or 5th lines will be executed. If $\\text{grade}\\ge75$ is `True`, Python will skip 4th and 5th lines; and if $\\text{grade} \\ge 75$ is `False`, Python will skip the 3rd line. So the execution order is **not** sequential. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has three types of selection statements: **`if`** statement, **`if . . . else`** statement, and **`if . . . elif . . . else`** statement.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<hr style=\"border: 0.3px dashed gray; background-color:white; width:15%; align: left\"></hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### `if` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**`if`** statement performs an action (or a set of actions) if a condition is `True` or skips the action if the condition is `False`. The following snippet accepts a floating point $\\text{grade}$ from the user and prints *Pass* and *Great job* in two separate lines if *grade >= 70*.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">grade = float(input('Enter a grade'))\n",
    ">if grade>=70:\n",
    ">    print('Pass')\n",
    ">    print('Great job!')\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1:** All statements that belong to `if` suite, must be indented and must have the same indentation. Otherwise, you will get <span style=\"color:red\"> IndentationError </span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** There is a difference between `=` and `==`. The `=`  is the assignment statement. $grade = 92$ will assign (bind) value of 92 to identifier $\\text{grade}$. On the other hand, `==` is used for evaluating a condition. $\\text{grade == 92}$ will evaluate if grade is equal to 92 and will return `True` if grade is indeed 92 and will return `False` if grade is not equal to 92. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 3:** The `if` condition could be *any* expression. Any non-zero value is True. Zero is False. Strings containing characters are True and empty strings ('', \"\", \"\"\"\"\"\") are False. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<hr style=\"border: 0.3px dashed gray; background-color:white; width:15%;\"></hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### `if . . . else` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "`if . . . else` statement performs an action(or a set of actions) if a condition is `True`; otherwise, it performs a different action. The following will show different messages depending on a student's grade received from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grade = float(input('Enter a grade'))\n",

    "    print('Try harder next time')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**A concise alternative**: Sometimes suites inside `if` and `else` are very short; in this case, you can put the whole `if . . . else` block in just one line. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">grade = float(input('Enter a grade'))\n",

    "**Note 2:** keyword `elif` is short for *else if*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 3:** `else` statement in `if . . . elif . . .else` is optional. It allows you to handle situations where none of the conditions in `if` and `elif` are satisfied. If you would like to use `else`, it must be placed after the last `elif` condition. \n",
